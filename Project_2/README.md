### Project 2 

## Data source: 
from Urban Ministries of Durham (url at: http://www.umdurham.org/ )

## Goals
UMD clothing and food pantries section shows the average number of households helped in the
past year and the amount of services given out (http://umdurham.org/what-we-do/food-pantry.html). Therefore to make it easier to visualize these numbers over the past decades. This visualization will help visualize:
* the temporal trend of number of clients served 
* temporal trend of amount of services given out
* Number of families (persons>=2) served each year
* Text variables in the dataset visualized by wordcloud

## Data Covereage: 
due to some inconsistencies and sparse data points before year 1998, I restricted the time frame to between 1998 and 2019. User can still select between this 
time frame.
