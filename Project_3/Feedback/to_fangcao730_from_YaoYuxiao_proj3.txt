
Hi Fang Cao,


Overall, your project3 draft has a good format and logic!



-------------Review of README-------------


Exploratory goals are clear and interesting, they make sense from the client’s point of view. 

However, it would be helpful to have more details to describe datasets used in the project and background information.

Adding methods might be a good idea to provide an outline of the project.


-------------Review of Makefile and Dockerfile----------------

Docker is used to define execution environments appropriately.

The project is organized modularly, with Make as the workflow manager.


-------------Review of Python and R scripts----------------


The project uses both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts well.

Your codes are neat and readable!


-------------Review of html report---------------------


Various kinds of plots do a good job of analyzing and summarizing.


More details about background and datasets would be helpful.


However, it would be better if underlying meaning of the hypotheses can be discussed.


Adding some explaination could be a good idea to help clients understand underlying meaning of the plot.


Also, you may want to add more transistion paragraphs to show connections between questions.



-------------Review of codes--------------------



Your codes are neat and readable!




Good luck in final project!
