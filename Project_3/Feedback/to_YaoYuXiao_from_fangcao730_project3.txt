-Is the project organized modularly, with Make as the workflow manager?
The project is well organized in R and Python but no docker or makefile

Does the project use both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts?
-Yes both were used and well organized. One thing in the python script. I also tried the pd.merge by client ID and got many duplicates
-Try merge by using EE UID and Client ID as keys. This works better than any ID alone. (although this is more of the dataset's problem)
-If i'm correct both UDES and entry exit has 5299 records. The resulting merge using EE UID is also 5299 records, which means the dataset you are using 
out of python wrangling might be missing some people as you removed the duplicates. I have no clue how anything is coded but give it a try

Is Docker used to define execution environments appropriately?
-No Dockerfile or makefiles seen in the repo
-Caution when you use absolute path to read in csv in your R markdown or to_csv in the python script. 
In Docker it won't recognize your local path

Are the plots appropriate for the data types, the hypotheses being tested, and the points being communicated?
-Great versatile use of ggplot2. i like the age pyramids, which is very clear and concise. 
-I know this is a draft and unfinished. Maybe consider adding a legend ?
-The y-axis seems to be off. You can use scale_y_continuous() to center 0 in the middle and positive values on both sides (I'm sure there are other great ways to do this too)..
-Pie charts are efficient. i like the color scheme too. 

How can the project be organized or documented more clearly?
-the organization is great. Maybe add some informative comment lines in your script along with the separators.

Is the purpose of the project communicated clearly?
-Yes and considering the unfinished parts, the R markdown file is very helpful.

Does the purpose of the project make sense from the clientâ€™s point of view? How could the project better serve the client?
-Not yet but seems to be moving in the right direction and the questions are very meaningful as well. 

Is the source of the data made clear? (Remember that this project can be part of your public portfolios, so people not familiar with UMD may see it).
-Yes, very clearly stated and Read me very clear 

Is the interpretation of figures clearly explained?
-Not added yet but can be easily explained just by looking at the plots. They are delivered effectively. 

Is the purpose and interpretation of analysis steps clearly communicated?
-Most analyses remain pretty preliminary and descriptive therefore not much explanation is needed. 

Are overall take-home messages clearly communicated?
-yes
