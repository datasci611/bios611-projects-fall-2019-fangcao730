# Background and data sources
From the shelters by Urban Ministries of Durham regarding the details of their clients 

# Goal of the Project 
1. Explore the relationship between vulnerability index at entry and baseline characteristics like disabilities, veteran status, health insurance coverage etc. 
2. Explore the relationship between different factors and the length of clients' stay in the shelters like number of disabilities, age and their vulnerability index
3. Explore whether UMD carries out the guideline on their vulnerability assessment using the client destination after leaving the shelters
